# machine-learning

Worksheets and sample code for the course _Machine Learning_ at the VU University Amsterdam.

## Worksheets

These are Jupyter notebooks to help you get started with performing machine learning experiments in Python. To get your environment properly set up, please read [getting set up](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-LXG5Lb76xQy70W2ZdannnYMEXRLt0CsoiaK0gTkmfY/edit?usp=sharing).

## Code samples

These are all the scripts used to create plots for the slides. I'll do my best to keep them readable, but I may not always have time. If you have any questions, feel free to send me a message, on github or post a thread on Canvas. 

## Homework

The latex files for the homework.
